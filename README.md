# Poverty, Population, and Transportation

## Overview
In high school, I took the public bus every single day. Overtime, I knew which stops had the most people waiting, and which areas of the city had the least stops. To me, it seemed as though the number of people riding and the distance between stops was positively correlated to neighborhoods where the median income was less. Is Miami's public transporation correlated to the median income of neighborhood zipcodes? This app was created to explore that question. As I continued downloading data and researching, I decided to explore whether population was a factor, and then I explored the relationship between income, population, and stops. I was particularly interested in Miami because I know that Miami has a good setup of public transportation, so I wanted to further explore how it may be set up according to certain variables. Overall, this project looks at why Miami's public transportation maps look the way they do, and how variables may affect how they look in the future!

## Miami Transportation

To create this app, I used data focused on Miami's bus routes, stops, zipcodes, and median income and median_population by zipcode. There, I downloaded the data required to map the routes, to show the bus stop markers on the map, and to plot the relationship between variables I wanted to explore. If you're interested in reading about the transportation in Miami visit: [Miami Dade Gov Transit](https://www.miamidade.gov/transit/ ). The data that was used in order to create this app came from Miami's Open Data Hub ([Routes] (http://gis-mdc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bus-route), [Stops] (http://gis-mdc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bus-stop)), as well as Miami Dade Matters, which is a cite controlled by a council whose purpose is to provide unbiased health data; quality program planning, management & evaluation; strong community partnerships in Miami-Dade & Monroe Counties; and targeted health care policy at the local, state, & national levels. ([Population Data per Zipcode] (http://www.miamidadematters.org/demographicdata/index/view?id=1469&localeTypeId=3), [Median Income Data per Zipcode] (http://www.miamidadematters.org/?module=demographicdata&controller=index&action=view&localeId=0&localeTypeId=3&tagFilter=0&id=2419). I also used an image of the [Miami skyline] (https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjHmMWglIjfAhUxTt8KHQ0iBFAQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanewteam.com%2Flocations%2Fcorporate-team-building-miami%2F&psig=AOvVaw2lLJpEsJAHXV9r8kXrBzhb&ust=1544081036780092).
